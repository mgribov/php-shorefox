Triptelligent REST API PHP5 client

Clients consuming the API are required to respect ETag and Cache-Control headers returned.
For now, only 1 storage engine is supported, MongoDB.
See src/Triptelligent/Storage for details

NOTE: Currently, supports read-only mode, i.e. no booking via POST to /bookings and no support for /config endpoint.

Make sure you install composer and run "./composer.phar dump-autoload" first.
